# Graphite

A simple Ivy theme designed for generating project documentation.


## Includes

This theme supports the following include files:

* `menu`

    This file will be used to construct the theme's main menu. It should contain
    a list of links, optionally with nested sub-lists.

* `head`

    If a `head.html` file is present in the includes folder its content will be
    included at the end of each page's `<head>` section. This file can be used
    to add custom CSS or JavaScript to a site without directly editing the
    theme's template files.

* `foot`

    If a `foot.html` file is present in the includes folder its content will
    be included at the end of each page's `<body>` section. This file can be
    used to add custom JavaScript to a site without directly editing the
    theme's template files.
